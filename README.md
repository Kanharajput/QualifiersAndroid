The Android SDK includes a class called ItemTouchHelper that is used to define what happens to RecyclerView list items when the user performs various touch actions, such as swipe, or drag and drop. Some of the common use cases are already implemented in a set of methods in ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback.

ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback lets you define which directions are supported for swiping and moving list items, and implement the swiping and moving behavior.
